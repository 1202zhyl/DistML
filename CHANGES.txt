1. Simplify APIs, allow users to use naive data for customized algorithms
2. With API change, only LR and LDA are remained to proove API is working well
3. Run examples on yarn and can use spark submit

[2015-10-15]
1. Add environment variable "PS_NETWORK_PREFIX", which is used by parameter servers
2. Fix issue in handling messages after iteration done 

[2015-10-12]

[2015-08-21]
1. add draft lda support
2. support iterative UDF in serverside

[2015-07-01]
1. removed feature of worker group to reduce code complexity, a new branch "workergrou" is created
2. use akka-io for data transport, which allows big data block transferring
3. start parameter servers in a separated thread, allows iterative training without resparting parameter servers
