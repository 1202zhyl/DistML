Distributed Machine Learning
=================
DistML can support model parallel. DistML is designed with following goals:
1. Run on Spark, easy to integrate with mllib
2. Support big models across multiple nodes, the model can be partitioned automatically or manually.
3. Provide API to write algorithm with big models
4. Provide samples for popular algorithms which are facing big problems in industry
5. Support both dense/sparse models/data
